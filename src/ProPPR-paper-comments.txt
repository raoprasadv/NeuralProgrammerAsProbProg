Overall, the writing could be significantly improved. Algorithmic and logical consquences are not made clear. 

(a) What is alpha' for reasonable programs? Looks like it should be 0! alpha' (for Page-Rank-Nibble) is suppo

P3: provably-correct and proveably-correct in the same line!

P3: Do not say what "linearized version of the proof space" means.
P3: epsilon is "the worst case approximation error" -- not defined.

P3: "inference .. in size independent of the size of the underlying database". What does this mean, i.e. how could it be so? 

P5 Table 2: 
     |N(u)| used but not defined. Is this just the outdegree of u?
     phi(u -> v) used but not defined.

P6 ppr(v0) not defined.

Table 2: What does "p=r=0" mean? is (bold) 0 a vector? Note earlier message about definining a vector properly. 

r is clearly not "0", it is defined for v0, and maps it to 1.
p is emptyset, not "0".

In the definition of push(u, alpha'), r[v] on the RHS in r[v] = r[v] + ... doesn't make sense because it may be undefined. 

Presumably it should "default" to 0.
